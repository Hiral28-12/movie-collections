The `MovieForm` component allows users to add movie details like title, language, release year, and OTT platform. It includes input validation, with year limits (1950 to current year) and auto-capitalization for fields. Errors display for invalid entries, and it updates the parent movie list using `setMovies`. Built for responsive, user-friendly forms.
